# 000rder
🚨 Warning: Usage Precautions for 000rder 🚨

1️⃣ Place the script directly on your Desktop 🖥️:
Ensure that the script file is saved in the Desktop directory. Placing it elsewhere might prevent the script from functioning properly or make the sorting process more complicated.

2️⃣ All files to be sorted must also be on the Desktop 🗂️:
Make sure all the files you want to sort are located on the Desktop and not inside any subfolders. If files are inside subfolders, the script will not be able to access or sort them correctly. This could lead to errors or unsorted files.

3️⃣ ⚠️ Do not include files that rely on other files to work:
If certain files depend on other files to function (e.g., executables with supporting resources or linked files), do not place them in the same directory as the files to be sorted. The script does not account for such dependencies, which could lead to errors, broken functionality, or incomplete sorting.

💡 Additional Tip: Before running 000rder, ensure that all files to be sorted are independent and do not require external resources.

⚡️ Follow these guidelines carefully to ensure smooth operation and avoid any unexpected issues.
